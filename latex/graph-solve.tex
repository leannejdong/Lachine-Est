How to construct a spanning tree with vertex-centric algorithm?

Ans: Remember, prims algorithm is for weighed graph to find out the minimum spanning tree.
It will span a new vertex in every interaction and after n iterations all the n vertices will be covered.
If you assign 1 as a weight to all the edges then also this algorithm will work. 
And if you want to calculate total number of spanning trees for the given graph then you can use matrix tree theorem.

The one I look for is prims algorithm for sure!
    
Two vertex sets are corresponding to set S and set V-S these two sets are represented by vector C in box 1.

0 entries are corresponding to vertices which are not considered yet means in V-S set.
1 entries are corresponding to vertices which are considered so far in S
And you consider cross edges (edges connecting S and V-S)
       
Two cases for C(i,j); 1, 0 or 0, 1 means exactly one of the vertex is not spanned yet i/j and you add it and iterate.
